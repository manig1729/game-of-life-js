# Conway's Game of Life

My take on coding John Conway's Game of life, the cellular automaton.

### To know more about the Game of life, check out these links :

It is quite a simple _game_ to code, but can do much more than what one expects.

This version of the game, however, has a few missing features.
* The game does not continue beyond the grid. In fact, the cell - checking for the ends of the grid is modified so that nothing escapes the grid
* It does not allow the user to manually input the cells which are 'alive'. Instead, it draws a random collection of cells around the middle of the grid, and sets off a glider on the bottom left corner.

Feel free to edit, use and play around with the code.
